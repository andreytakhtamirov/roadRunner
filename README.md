# roadRunner
 simple arcade-style game made with swing on java
 
 The player (yellow square) navigates around the enemies (red squares), which change direction randomly, and needs to collect the small yellow coin located past all the enemies. The levels progress with the speeds of the enemies getting faster and faster, adding points with each progression.
 The game ends when the player runs out of lives after being struck by an enemy.
 
 A flat file of high scores can be read from the title and end game screens.
